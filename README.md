# GCalGrow
GCalGrow is a Chrome extension that hides the Google bar and the Search bar in the Google Calendar interface, leaving more pixels for your calendar.

# Roadmap
## Version 2.0
* Switching to using CSS rather than JavaScript to hide UI components. When using Javascript, the UI components are removed after the page is loaded, causing a brief "flash" of the UI components before the Javascript executes and removes them. CSS is applied before the page renders, preventing a flash from occurring.
* Add "Hide/Show" buttons to the hidden UI components.
## Version 3.0
* Allow hiding (and showing) the left sidebar.
